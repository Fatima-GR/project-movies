# Project Movies

In this week's project, we had a nice and productive time pair programming and we learned:

- How to build multi-page applications using React Router.
- How to pass information such as product ids, or blog post titles in the url and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content.
- Practice using APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`.
- The useHistory hook and its two of the most commonly used methods: history.push("/") and history.back().
- The useParams hook.
